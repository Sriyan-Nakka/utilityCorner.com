# Font Viewer

Welcome to Font Viewer! This is a project where you can preview your downloaded .otf, .ttf, .woff and .woff2 fonts.

You can choose to preview the font with the given sample text or with your own custom text, or you can preview multiple fonts for a good font combination for your website! This is useful for me and any other developers or any other person who wants to preview their downloaded fonts. Hope you like it :)
